To quotes: Add the title of the corresponding article where the first instance of the quote was found. 
To quotes: Add an "isvisible" boolean to each quote that is only editable and visible in admin mode. When isvisible is true, the quote is displayed to users. When isvisible is false, it's not visible to users and shows in admin mode as greyed out with the option to re-set it to visible.
Filter out quotes that are not directly uttered by the quote author. Don't include quotes that take about what someone said. ONLY GRAB THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THE QUOTE: THE QUOTE ITSELF.
Add a field called "context" to each quote and provide context for each quote. If that isn't possible, provide a 2 to 3 sentence summary of the article that the quote was first discovered in.
Add a headshot photo to each quote with a headshot (when available) for the quote author
Add the article publishing date to each quote
